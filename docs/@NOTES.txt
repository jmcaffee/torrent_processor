Application Lifecycle
====================

Inputs:
	- Application is called via uTorrent -> Preferences -> Advanced -> Run Program functionality

Process (kicked off as a result of an input listed above):
	- Check for app lock
		- Exit application if lock exists (the application is already processing)
		
	- Claim app lock
		
	- Check for cache id
		- Cache id exists?
			Y - Retrieve torrent list (using cache id)
			N - Retrieve full torrent list
			  - Store cache id in DB
	
	- Update DB torrent list including status, ratio, etc.

				- Log the fact that torrent has been removed (and it was not requested by TP)
				- Remove the torrents from the torrents list and the torrent state list in the DB
	
	- Pull list of torrents that have completed downloading AND have not yet been processed
		- Queue torrents for processing
		- Process torrents
			- For each torrent
				- Using RoboCopy
					- Copy torrent download to processing dir
						- Torrents with 'Movie' tag are copied to UnsortedMovies folder

		- Queue torrents for removal and clean up (uTorrent)
		- Process torrents

				- Update torrent state in DB to 'awaiting removal'

INSTALLING
======================

Install uTorrent

Install uTorrent's webui

Install ruby (1.9.2)

Install sqlite 3
	Download the precompiled files, including the library, from http://sqlite.org/download.html
	Currently:
			sqlite-shell-win32-x86-3070701.zip
			sqlite-dll-win32-x86-3070701.zip
			sqlite-analyzer-win32-x86-3070701.zip
	
	Extract sqlite-dll-win32-x86-3070701.zip to the ruby bin folder on c:\
		In this case, I extracted it to c:\tools\Ruby\Ruby192\bin
		
	Extract sqlite-shell-win32-x86-3070701.zip and sqlite-analyzer-win32-x86-3070701.zip to either the Ruby bin folder or another
	folder on the C: drive.
		In this case, I extracted them to C:\tools\sqlite3
		
	Add folder to system PATH variable (if SQLite tools were extracted to a folder other than ruby/bin):
		PATH var can be set by right-clicking My Computer and choosing Properties -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables
		Under System Variables (*not* User variables for xxx), edit the PATH variable and add (sans quotes) ';C:\tools\sqlite3' at the end.
